/**
 * talon-fusefs — TypeScript boundary over the FUSE addon
 * (native/talon-fusefs, `bin/talon-fusefs.node`).
 *
 * The addon mounts the talon:// namespace at ~/.talon/ns while the
 * daemon runs: file-backed mounts are served as symlinks (the kernel
 * follows them — heavy file I/O never crosses the FUSE boundary) and
 * synthetic mounts (proc/, plugins/) are served live through a
 * threadsafe callback bridge into the JS Vfs.
 *
 * Per-arch artifact like blake3-napi: present on binary-channel and
 * source installs, absent otherwise — absence simply means the FUSE
 * layer is off and the namespace falls back to the symlink farm.
 * `TALON_FUSEFS_NODE` overrides the location, `TALON_NO_FUSEFS=1`
 * disables it. Linux-only: fuser's pure-Rust mount path (no libfuse
 * link) needs only /dev/fuse + fusermount3 at runtime.
