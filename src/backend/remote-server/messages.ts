 * objects. Kilo and OpenCode previously duplicated the same `findLastAssistantMessage`
 * helper — same body, drifted formatting, identical `info as unknown as
 * KiloAssistantInfo` / `OpenCodeAssistantInfo` casts. This module centralises
 * the walker and pushes the `info` typing out as a generic the caller supplies.
 *
 * The runtime guard (`info.role === "assistant"`) lives here and runs once;
 * the generic just labels what the caller intends to consume. No new
 * unsafe-cast surface is introduced — callers no longer cast through
 * `unknown` themselves.
