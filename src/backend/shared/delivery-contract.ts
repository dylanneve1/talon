/**
 * Delivery-contract text — single source of truth for "how a reply
 * reaches the user" documentation.
 *
 * The response-flow contract is a property of the BACKEND (claude-sdk
 * and openai-agents enforce strict tool-only delivery; codex / kilo /
 * opencode accept plain assistant text), while the delivery TOOL NAMES
 * are a property of the FRONTEND (telegram/discord ship `end_turn` /
 * `send` / `react`; native ships `end_turn` / `send_message` /
 * `react`; teams ships `end_turn` / `send_message`). Before
 * this module, the strict contract was hardcoded into the frontend
 * prompt files (prompts/telegram.md etc.) — buried mid-prompt where
 * models routinely missed it on the first turn of a session, and
 * contradicted by the text-mode backends' own suffixes.
 *
 * Backends now build their suffix from here and append it via
 * `prepareSystemPrompt({ backendSuffix })`, which places the contract
 * at the END of the static prompt — the highest-salience position —
 * without touching the prompt-cache-friendly static/dynamic split.
 *
 * Also here:
 *   - `buildFlowViolationReminder` — frontend-aware [FLOW VIOLATION]
 *     re-prompt text (the shared constant used to hardcode telegram's
 *     tool names, which made the reminder wrong on Teams).
 *   - `buildFirstTurnReminder` — a one-line nudge appended to the
 *     formatted user prompt on the FIRST turn of a session. First
 *     turns are where flow violations cluster: the model hasn't seen
 *     the contract in action yet. One short line on turn 0 is far
 *     cheaper than the 2x-token violation retry it prevents.
 *
 * The contract bodies live in `prompts/system/contract-*.md`
 * (package-owned templates, see core/prompt/templates.ts). The
 * one-line runtime reminders below stay in code: they are
 * logic-adjacent strings, like log messages.
