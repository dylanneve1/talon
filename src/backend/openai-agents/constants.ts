## OpenAI Agents Delivery

Two ways to deliver a reply — pick whichever fits:

- **Plain text** — your final response text is the reply. Just answer
  normally.
- **Delivery tools** — call \`end_turn(text="...", reply_to=N)\` for
  threaded replies, \`send(type="text"|"photo"|"poll"|...)\` for rich
  content, or \`react(emoji="...")\` for emoji acknowledgements.

If you call a delivery tool, don't also repeat the same text in plain
output — Talon dedupes but it's cleaner to commit to one route.
