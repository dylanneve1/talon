/**
 * A QR-linked WhatsApp session must not be mistaken for an unpaired one.
 *
 * Baileys only sets `creds.registered` on the pairing-CODE path. Scan the QR
 * instead and the session is fully authenticated — it has `me`, `account` and
 * app-state keys, it sends and receives — while `registered` stays false for
 * the lifetime of the link.
 *
 * Reading that flag alone therefore parked a healthy session on its first
 * ordinary disconnect, and then `parkUntilPaired` waited on the same flag, so
 * nothing short of a process restart could get it back.
 *
 * These assert on the real shape of a QR session's creds, taken from a live
 * install, rather than on a hand-made object that happens to satisfy the fix.
