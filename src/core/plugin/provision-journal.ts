/**
 * Provision journal — what the provisioners changed, and the post-restart
 * report that documents it.
 *
 * Two small persisted pieces under ~/.talon/data/:
 *
 *  - provision-events.json — a capped rolling log of provisioning
 *    mutations ("upgraded mempalace 3.3.5 → 3.8.0", "palace wing-name
 *    migration: Migrated 3 drawer(s)."). Every action a provisioner
 *    reports lands here, whichever boot or background pass produced it.
 *
 *  - provision-report-pending.json — armed by a frontend's /update
 *    command just before the respawn. The successor process, once its
 *    frontends are serving, reads the marker and messages the chat that
 *    asked for the update with whatever provisioning changed during the
 *    new boot — closing the loop that the pre-restart reply can't see.
