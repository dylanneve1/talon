/**
 * Lua trigger runner — executes a trigger script inside a WASM-sandboxed
 * Lua 5.4 VM (wasmoon), speaking the same stdout protocol bash/python/node
 * triggers use (see core/background/triggers.ts).
 *
 * Why a separate process at all: the trigger supervisor's whole contract
 * (kill/respawn, SIGTERM grace, log streaming, TALON_FIRE line scanning)
 * is built around child processes. Lua therefore runs as `talon _lua-run
 * <script>` — the same self-reinvocation shape MCP supervision uses
 * (util/mcp-launcher.ts) — so it works identically for tsx source runs,
 * npm installs, and bun-compiled binaries with no source tree on disk.
 *
 * Sandbox (verified empirically, not aspirational):
 *   - wasmoon is Lua 5.4 compiled to WASM under emscripten. The VM's
 *     filesystem is MEMFS: `io.open("/etc/hostname")` returns nil, and
 *     `os.getenv` sees only emscripten's stub environment — the host
 *     process env is invisible. No sockets, no subprocesses.
 *   - The full Lua stdlib (string/table/math/os.time/os.clock/io) works
 *     INSIDE the VM; io/os just can't reach the host.
 *   - The only host surface is the injected `talon` API below.
 *
 * Host API (global `talon` table):
 *   talon.fire(text)  — emit `TALON_FIRE: <text>` on stdout (newlines in
 *                       text collapsed to spaces); fires a mid-run wake-up.
 *   talon.log(text)   — stderr line; lands in the trigger run-log as
 *                       `[stderr] …`.
 *   talon.sleep(ms)   — synchronous-looking sleep. Implemented as a JS
 *                       promise the Lua thread suspends on via wasmoon's
 *                       `:await()` (the engine yields the coroutine and
 *                       resumes it when the promise settles).
 *
 * Fire-protocol forgery guard: ALL VM-visible stdout — print(), io.write,
 * io.output():write, anything emscripten emits — funnels through
 * console.log (emscripten's `out` channel). We patch BOTH console.log and
 * process.stdout.write for the run: under node, console.log delegates to
 * the stream's write method, but under bun (compiled binaries) console.log
 * is native and bypasses it entirely — patching only the stream was
 * verified to let a forged print() through in the compiled binary.
 * Everything is line-buffered: any script-originated line starting with
 * `TALON_FIRE:` is escaped with one leading space, which defeats the
 * supervisor's startsWith() check while keeping the text readable in the
 * run-log. Only talon.fire writes through the saved raw stream method, and
 * it terminates any pending partial script line first so a trailing
 * io.write fragment can't glue onto (and break) the protocol line. This is
 * an anti-accident/anti-confusion guard at the stdout choke points —
 * the host sandbox above is what provides actual isolation.
 *
 * Known stdio quirk (verified): `io.write("text")` WITHOUT a trailing
 * newline sits in emscripten's internal TTY buffer and is never flushed —
 * not at chunk end, not at engine close — so it's silently lost, exactly
 * like unflushed C stdio. Scripts should end stdout writes with "\n"
 * (print() always does).
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 — script completed; 1 — Lua error (message + traceback on
 * stderr); 2 — usage error (no script path / unreadable file).
