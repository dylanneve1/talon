 * sentinel the gateway already treats as falsy/unrouted.
 *
 * Accepts:
 *   - actual non-zero integer numbers (`352042062`, `-1001426819337`)

 * `idSchema` is for message/user/reply IDs (always positive) and
 * would reject the negative IDs Telegram uses for groups/channels —
 * which was the bug PR #150 shipped with: heartbeat outbound `send`
 * to a supergroup got `expected number, received string` (the model
 * sees a `number` JSON schema, but zod rejects negatives before the
 * gateway sees the request). Gateway-side handling for negative
 * chat_ids was already tested and correct — only the tool-input
 * schema layer needed the fix.

// STRING-typed on purpose. Discord snowflakes are 17–19 digits and exceed 2^53,
// so an unquoted JSON number loses precision at parse time and Zod's `.int()`
// rejects it as too_big. A `union([number, string])` generates an `anyOf` JSON
// schema, so the model still passes a (corrupt) number — a description hint
// isn't enough to stop it. `z.coerce.string()` generates a `{ type: "string" }`
// schema, so the model quotes the ID (exact digits survive), while still
// accepting a number at runtime by coercing it to a string. Everything is
// normalized to a digit-string at the boundary; the bridge/handlers consume the
// string directly (Discord) or `Number()` it (Telegram).
