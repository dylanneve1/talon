/**
 * Native tools — Talon's own shell/filesystem primitives, the replacement
 * for the SDK's built-in Bash/Read/Write/Edit/Glob/Grep. They are only
 * surfaced when `config.nativeTools` is enabled (see the tool composition in
 * the MCP server); otherwise the built-ins are used.
 *
 * Their extra power over the built-ins: every one honours the active
 * `teleport` target, so with a teleport engaged they run ON a companion
 * device (via the mesh exec/fs channel) instead of on the daemon host.
 * Talon's namespace (~/.talon/ns) is a real filesystem location — its
 * files are reached by their ordinary real paths, with no address scheme
 * to translate, so the same path works here, in a bare shell, and in any
 * spawned process.
