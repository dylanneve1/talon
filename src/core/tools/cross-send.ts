 * mounted. The gateway serves it as a chat-free action (see
 * engine/gateway-actions/cross-send.ts), so it works from background runs
 * with no ambient chat, and the target frontend is named EXPLICITLY —
 * never inferred from the shape of a numeric id.

    description: `Send a message — text, or a photo/video/file/voice note — through ANY enabled messaging frontend, including one this chat does not live on. Use it to reach someone on another platform (e.g. from Telegram or a heartbeat run, message a WhatsApp number). For the current chat, keep using the normal delivery tools (end_turn / send / send_message).

Target forms:
- whatsapp: a phone number with country code ("+353871234567" or "353871234567"), a wa_dm_<number>/wa_group_<id> chat id, or a raw JID; a bare numeric chat id works only for chats already seen since startup
- telegram / discord / teams / native: the numeric chat id, as a string (Telegram supergroups/channels are negative, DMs positive)

Media: give file_path (a workspace file) or url (a public URL, fetched by the platform); text becomes the caption. The kind is inferred from the extension — pass media_type to override (e.g. send a .webp as a sticker rather than a photo). file_id is Telegram-only; other platforms have no equivalent and will say so.

Examples:
  send_via(frontend="whatsapp", target="+353871234567", text="On my way")
  send_via(frontend="whatsapp", target="+353871234567", file_path="media/plot.png", text="here's the chart")
  send_via(frontend="telegram", target="-1001426819337", text="Build is green")
