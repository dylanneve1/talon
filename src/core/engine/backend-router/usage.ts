/**
 * One usage snapshot per backend — what `/usage`, the `plan_usage` tool and
 * `list_backends` all read.
 *
 * It lives in core rather than in the frontend presentation layer because
 * the gateway tools need it too, and core cannot import a frontend. The
 * split is: this module *gathers* (plan windows, headroom, and the reason
 * there is nothing to show), renderers *format*.
 *
 * Nothing here boots a backend. Reading a number should never cost a
 * subprocess per idle provider, so a backend that isn't running is listed
 * with a reason instead of being woken or omitted.
