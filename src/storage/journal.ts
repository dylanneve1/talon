/**
 * Event journal — the bus's durable tail in talon.db.
 *
 * The task table and the bus ring are deliberately in-memory: they
 * describe a live process. What IS truthful to persist is history —
 * "what happened" — and every task settlement, turn completion, and
 * future event family already flows through the bus as a typed,
 * content-free record. So the journal is one subscriber (wired at the
 * composition root) appending every published event, and history
 * surfaces (`talon events --history`, `talon ps --all`) read it back —
 * across daemon restarts, with or without a daemon running.
 *
 * Appending must never hurt the daemon: failures are logged once and
 * swallowed, and retention is pruned opportunistically (every
 * PRUNE_EVERY appends) rather than on a timer.
