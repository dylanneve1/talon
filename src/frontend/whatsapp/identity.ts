/**
 * Identity resolution — the LID/phone-number duality.
 *
 * WhatsApp addresses people two ways. The historical form is the phone
 * number (`353834733284@s.whatsapp.net`, "PN"); the newer privacy form
 * is a linked identity (`180753715482747@lid`, "LID") that hides the
 * number. Which one arrives depends on the sender's privacy settings and
 * the chat's addressing mode, and neither is derivable from the other —
 * they are looked up.
 *
 * This matters because every allowlist a human writes is phone numbers.
 * Matching those against a raw `remoteJid` silently ignores anyone whose
 * messages arrive as a LID — which is exactly what happened on the first
 * real message to the live account.
 *
 * So every identity resolves to BOTH forms and matches on either.
 * Baileys carries the counterpart on the message key (`remoteJidAlt` /
 * `participantAlt`) when it knows it, and its signal store can look one
 * up otherwise; results are cached because the mapping is stable.
