/**
 * WhatsApp frontend runtime — the state every module shares.
 *
 * `createWhatsAppFrontend` used to hold all of this as closure variables
 * with every handler nested inside it. It is now one explicit object,
 * constructed once, that each module (access, inbound, connection) takes
 * as its first parameter. The runtime carries the parsed settings, the
 * allow-lists and the live socket state; the modules own the behaviour.
