/**
 * `/usage` data gathering — plan limits across every backend the config
 * exposes, not just the one serving this chat.
 *
 * Most backends have no plan to report: a gateway (Kilo, OpenCode) bills
 * through whichever provider it fronts, and an API-key install pays per
 * token with no window to be near the end of. Those are listed with a
 * reason rather than omitted, so the answer to "am I close to a limit?" is
 * never silence — and since the plan-aware router landed they carry a
 * headroom figure too, derived from a local token budget where one is
 * configured, so "which backend has room?" is answerable for all of them.
 *
 * The gathering itself lives in core (`engine/backend-router/usage.ts`),
 * because the gateway tools need the same data and core cannot import a
 * frontend. This module is the rendering adapter over it.
