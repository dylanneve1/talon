/**
 * Staleness guard for process-ending commands.

 * redelivery that caused the restart loop, but it can't be guaranteed —
 * the confirmation is a network call on the way out, and a SIGKILL, a
 * crash, or a 409 from two pollers skips it entirely. Any command that
 * ends the process is therefore also checked for age: it must be newer
 * than this process, because a `/restart` issued before we booted has
 * either already been served (redelivery) or refers to a daemon that is
 * no longer running.
 *
 * Only self-terminating commands are gated. Ordinary messages sent while
 * the daemon was down are real work and must still be processed.
