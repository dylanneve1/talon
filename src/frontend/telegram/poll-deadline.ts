/**
 * Long-poll deadline — the reason the bot went deaf until restarted.
 *
 * grammY's client aborts an API call only after `timeoutSeconds`, which
 * defaults to 500. A getUpdates whose TCP connection is silently dropped
 * (no FIN, no RST — the peer or a middlebox just stops answering) sits in
 * kernel retransmit backoff for that whole window, and nothing else polls
 * meanwhile: every incoming message queues at Telegram. Observed live on
 * 2026-09-24 — an IPv6 socket to api.telegram.org stalled with 312 bytes
 * unacked while fresh connections worked instantly.
 *
 * A healthy getUpdates answers within its own `timeout` (the long-poll
 * window, grammY default 30s), so anything well past that is a dead
 * connection. This transformer gives each getUpdates attempt a deadline of
 * that window plus a grace; on expiry the fetch aborts, grammY treats it as
 * a network error, and re-polls on a fresh connection 3s later. Other
 * methods keep the client default — uploads can legitimately run long.
