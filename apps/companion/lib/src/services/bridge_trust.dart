/// The daemon serves the bridge over TLS with a certificate it minted
/// itself, identified by the SHA-256 of its DER (the fingerprint the daemon
/// prints and `/health` advertises). The active pin lives here — set by
/// AppState whenever the connection profile changes — so every transport
/// that reaches the bridge honours it: BridgeClient's own IOClient, and the
/// HttpClient that Flutter's Image.network creates internally (reachable
/// only through [HttpOverrides]).
///
/// Semantics: an otherwise-untrusted certificate is accepted exactly when
/// its fingerprint matches the pin. Certificates that already chain to a
/// platform-trusted CA (reverse-proxy setups) never reach this code — the
/// bad-certificate callback fires only when normal validation failed.
///
/// It also carries the profile's client certificate (reverse proxies that
/// demand one): an avatar loaded by Image.network has to get through the
/// proxy too, and [createHttpClient] is the only hook into that client.
