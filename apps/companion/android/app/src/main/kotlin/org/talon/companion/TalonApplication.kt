/**
 * Registers the `talon/shizuku` platform channel on the FOREGROUND SERVICE's
 * Flutter engine.
 *
 * The mesh loop (SSE + exec) runs inside the foreground service's own isolate
 * so teleport keeps working after the activity is gone — but that engine is
 * created by flutter_foreground_task, not by MainActivity, so
 * MainActivity.configureFlutterEngine never runs for it. Without this hook,
 * background exec would silently lose Shizuku elevation and fall back to app
 * UID. Registered from the Application (not the activity) because after a
 * reboot or a START_STICKY restart the service comes up with NO activity ever
 * having existed.
 *
 * Pub plugins (shared_preferences, geolocator, …) don't need this — the
 * FlutterEngine constructor auto-registers them via GeneratedPluginRegistrant.
 * Only this hand-rolled channel must be attached manually.
